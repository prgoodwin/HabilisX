@inproceedings{Kristensson2008,
abstract = {We report on a design exploration into how a large multi-touch tabletop display can be used for information visualization. We designed an interface where users explored a tagged photo collection by bi-manual manipulation of the collections' tag cloud. User feedback showed that despite the availability of multi-touch most of the actual interactions were single-touch. However, some particular natural actions, such as grabbing the tag cloud and partitioning it into two parts, were often carried with both hands. Thus our user study indicates that multi-touch can act as a useful complementary interaction method in information visualization interfaces.},

@article{Ball2007,
abstract = {Visual analysts are engaged with the arduous task of scrutinizing increasingly larger data sets. Where conventional desktop displays are reaching their limits in terms of performance efficiency with large data sets, analysts can turn to larger displays. In a world of extensive multi-scale data sets, large high-resolution displays have the potential to show both more overview and detail for a given data set than their smaller counterparts. In addition, people are able to use their embodied resources, such as spatial memory, proprioception, and optical flow to help them maintain orientation and improve performance times on analytic tasks when using larger displays. This paper looks at how physical navigation, physically interacting with large scale visualizations (e.g. walking, crouching, moving the head), affects user performance times on analytic tasks, such as finding patterns in geospatial data. The paper extends the space–scale diagram to take into account physical navigation and explains the theoretical repercussions. The paper then explains an empirical study performed for the purpose of further understanding how physical and virtual navigation affect performance times of tasks on varying size displays. In general, we found that large displays can decrease performance time of basic visualization tasks by more than ten times. In addition, we found overwhelming evidence from the empirical study that participants preferred physical navigation over virtual navigation (e.g. mouse interaction). Specifically, we found that for a number of tasks 100\% of the participants chose to physically navigate—physically moving to different areas on the display instead of using virtual navigation to manipulate the view on the display.},

abstract = {Effective management of documents on computers has been a central user interface problem for many years. One common approach involves using 2D spatial layouts of icons representing the documents, particularly for information workspace tasks. This approach takes advantage of human 2D spatial cognition. More recently, several 3D spatial layouts have engaged 3D spatial cognition capabilities. Some have attempted to use spatial memory in 3D virtual environments. However, there has been no proof to date that spatial memory works the same way in 3D virtual environments as it does in the real world. We describe a new technique for document management called the Data Mountain, which allows users to place documents at arbitrary positions on an inclined plane in a 3D desktop virtual environment using a simple 2D interaction technique. We discuss how the design evolved in response to user feedback. We also describe a user study that shows that the Data Mountain does take advantage of spatial memory. Our study shows that the Data Mountain has statistically reliable advantages over the Microsoft Internet Explorer Favorites mechanism for managing documents of interest in an information workspace.},
