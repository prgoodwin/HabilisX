abstract=We describe a new type of graphical user interface widget, known as a "tracking menu." A tracking menu consists of a cluster of graphical buttons, and as with traditional menus, the cursor can be moved within the menu to select and interact with items. However, unlike traditional menus, when the cursor hits the edge of the menu, the menu moves to continue tracking the cursor. Thus, the menu always stays under the cursor and close at hand.In this paper we define the behavior of tracking menus, show unique affordances of the widget, present a variety of examples, and discuss design characteristics. We examine one tracking menu design in detail, reporting on usability studies and our experience integrating the technique into a commercial application for the Tablet PC. While user interface issues on the Tablet PC, such as preventing round trips to tool palettes with the pen, inspired tracking menus, the design also works well with a standard mouse and keyboard configuration.

title=How do people organize their desks?: Implications for the design of office information systems
journal=ACM Trans. Inf. Syst.
issue_date=Jan. 1983
volume=1
number=1
month=jan
year=1983
numpages=14
abstract=This paper describes a series of interviews focusing on the way professional and clerical office workers organize the information in their desks and offices. A number of implications for designing &quot;natural&quot; and convenient computer-based information systems are discussed. Two principal claims are made: (1) A very important function of desk organization is to remind the user of things to do, not just to help the user find desired information. Failing to support this function may seriously impair the usefulness of electronic office systems, and explicitly facilitating it may provide an important advantage for automated office systems over their nonautomated predecessors. (2) The cognitive difficulty of categorizing information is an important factor in explaining how people organize their desks. Computer-based systems may help with this difficulty by (a) doing as much automatic classification as possible (e.g., based on access dates , and (b) including untitled &quot;piles &quot; of information arranged by physical location as well as explicitly titled and logically arranged &quot;files.&quot; Several other implications for the design of electronic office systems are discussed, and some differences in how people organize their desks are described.

title=Data mountain: using spatial memory for document management
booktitle=Proceedings of the 11th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology
series=UIST '98
year=1998
numpages=10
keywords=3D user interfaces, desktop VR, document mangement, information visualization, spatial cognition, spatial memory
abstract=Effective management of documents on computers has been a central user interface problem for many years.  One common approach involves using 2D spatial layouts of icons representing the documents, particularly for information workspace tasks. This approach takes advantage of human 2D spatial cognition. More recently, several 3D spatial layouts have engaged 3D spatial cognition capabilities. Some have attempted to use spatial memory in 3D virtual environments. However, there has been no proof to date that spatial memory works the same way in 3D virtual environments as it does in the real world. We describe a new technique for document management called the Data Mountain, which allows users to place documents at arbitrary positions on an inclined plane in a 3D desktop virtual environment using a simple 2D interaction technique. We discuss how the design evolved in response to user feedback. We also describe a user study that shows that the Data Mountain does take advantage of spatial memory. Our study shows that the Data Mountain has statistically reliable advantages over the Microsoft Internet Explorer Favorites mechanism for managing documents of interest in an information workspace.

booktitle=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
series=CHI '00
year=2000
numpages=8
keywords=3D user interfaces, spatial cognition, spatial memory, window managers
abstract=The Task Gallery is a window manager that uses interactive 3D graphics to provide direct support for task management and document comparison, lacking from many systems implementing the desktop metaphor. User tasks appear as artwork hung on the walls of a virtual art gallery, with the selected task on a stage. Multiple documents can be selected and displayed side-by-side using 3D space to provide uniform and intuitive scaling. The Task Gallery hosts any Windows application, using a novel redirection mechanism that routes input and output between the 3D environment and unmodified 2D Windows applications. User studies suggest that the Task Gallery helps with task management, is enjoyable to use, and that the 3D metaphor evokes spatial memory and cognition.

abstract=The task of managing and accessing large information spaces is a problem in large scale cognition.  Emerging technologies for 3D visualization and interactive animation offer potential solutions to this problem, especially when the structure of the information can be visualized.  We describe one of tehse Information Visualization techniques, called the Cone Tree, which is used for visualizing hierarchical information structures.  The hierarchy is preseneted in 3D to meximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure.  Interactive animation is used to shift some of the user's cognitive load to the human perceptual system.

abstract=We describe the i-LAND environment which constitutes an example of our vision of the workspaces of the future, in this case supporting cooperative work of dynamic teams with changing needs. i-LAND requires and provides new forms of human-computer interaction and new forms of computer-supported cooperative work. Its design is based on an integration of information and architectural spaces, implications of new work practices and an empirical requirements study informing our design. i-LAND consists of several roomware components, i.e. computer-aug- mented objects integrating room elements with information technology. We present the current realization of i-LAND in terms of an interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, two computer-enhanced chairs, and two bridges for the Passage-mechanism. This is complemented by the description of the creativity support application and the technological infrastructure. The paper is accompanied by a video figure in the CHI99 video program.

year=2002
numpages=8
keywords=Fitts' law, events, goal crossing, goal passing, graphical user interfaces, input, input performance, interaction techniques, pointing, widgets
abstract=Today's graphical interactive systems largely depend upon pointing actions, i.e. entering an object and selecting it. In this paper we explore whether an alternate paradigm --- crossing boundaries --- may substitute or complement pointing as another fundamental interaction method. We describe an experiment in which we systematically evaluate two target-pointing tasks and four goal-crossing tasks, which differ by the direction of the movement variability constraint (collinear vs. orthogonal) and by the nature of the action (pointing vs. crossing, discrete vs. continuous). We found that participants' temporal performance in each of the six tasks was dependent on the index of difficulty formulated in the same way as in Fitts' law, but that the parameters differ by task. We also found that goal crossing completion time was shorter or no longer than pointing performance under the same index of difficulty. These regularities, as well as qualitative characterizations of crossing actions and their application in HCI, lay the foundation for designing crossing-based user interfaces.

title=An introduction to physically based modeling: particle system dynamics
booktitle=SIGGRAPH Course Notes
series=SIGGRAPH Course Notes '97
year=1997
abstract=Physically based modeling has become an important new approach to computer animation and computer graphics modeling. Although physically based modeling is inherently a mathematical subject, the math involved needn’t be any more difficult nor esoteric than the math that underlies many other areas of computer graphics, such as ray tracing or surface modeling. Many papers on the subject have presupposed a specialized mathematical background that many members of the computer graphics community lack. Consequently, many capable computer graphics practitioners, despite their interest in the subject, have simply been put off by the density of the math. This course addresses the need to make the principles and methods of physically based modeling accessible to a broader computer graphics audience—those who are familiar with mainstream computer graphics and have the usual basic computer graphics math, such as vector/matrix manipulations, but whose first year calculus course may be only dimly remem-bered. Course topics include modeling the dynamics of particle systems and rigid bodies, basic numerical methods for differential equations, simulation of deformable surfaces, collision detection, modeling energy functions and hard constraints, and the dynamics of collision and contact.

title=Can motion increase user interface bandwidth in complex systems?
year=1997
volume=2
abstract=Current user interfaces to complex systems suffer from data displays which are increasingly cumbersome since the representation techniques exceed the human's perceptual capacity to efficiently interpret them. New display dimensions are required to support the user in integrating and relating information across displays and representations. Advances in technology have made animation a viable alternative. Motion holds promise as a perceptually rich and efficient display dimension but little is known about its properties for information display. We summarize types of movement characterization from diverse disciplines and proposes an initial taxonomy of motion properties and application to serve as a framework for further empirical investigation into motion as a useful display dimension

numpages=10
keywords=annotation, augmented reality, environment management, labeling, view management, virtual environments, wearable computing
abstract=We describe a view-management component for interactive 3D user interfaces. By view management, we mean maintaining visual constraints on the projections of objects on the view plane, such as locating related objects near each other, or preventing objects from occluding each other. Our view-management component accomplishes this by modifying selected object properties, including position, size, and transparency, which are tagged to indicate their constraints. For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible.We introduce algorithms that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which objects can be placed to avoid occlusion. Layout decisions from previous frames are taken into account to reduce visual discontinuities. We present augmented reality and virtual reality examples to which we have applied our approach, including a dynamically labeled and annotated environment.

abstract=This paper reports a laboratory experiment that investigated the relative effects of images, transitions, and interactivity styles used in animated interfaces in two decision making domains. Interfaces used either realistic or abstract images, smooth or abrupt transitions, and parallel or sequential interactivity. Results suggest that decision making performance is influenced by the task domain, the user experience, the image, transition, and interactivity styles used in animated interfaces. Subjects performed better with animated interfaces based on realistic rather than abstract images. Subjects were more accurate with smooth rather than abrupt animation. Subjects were more accurate and enjoyed more the animation with parallel rather than sequential interactivity. Implications on the design of animated interfaces for decision making are provided.

abstract=It is often difficult in computer graphics applications to understand spatial relationships between objects in a 3D scene or effect changes to those objects without specialized visualization and manipulation techniques. We present a set of three-dimensional tools (widgets) called “shadows” that not only provide valuable perceptual cues about the spatial relationships between objects, but also provide a direct manipulation interface to constrained transformation techniques. These shadow widgets provide two advances over previous techniques. First, they provide high correlation between their own geometric feedback and their effects on the objects they control. Second, unlike some other 3D widgets, they do not obscure the objects they control.

year=2005
numpages=10
keywords=delimiters, gestures, marking, pen input, tablets
abstract=We present a quantitative analysis of delimiters for pen gestures. A delimiter is "something different" in the input stream that a computer can use to determine the structure of input phrases. We study four techniques for delimiting a selection-action gesture phrase consisting of lasso selection plus marking-menu-based command activation. Pigtail is a new technique that uses a small loop to delimit lasso selection from marking (Fig. 1). Handle adds a box to the end of the lasso, from which the user makes a second stroke for marking. Timeout uses dwelling with the pen to delimit the lasso from the mark. Button uses a button press to signal when to delimit the gesture. We describe the role of delimiters in our Scriboli pen interaction testbed, and show how Pigtail supports scope selection, command activation, and direct manipulation all in a single fluid pen gesture.

year=1999
keywords=Multi-scale Views, Detail-in-Context, Viewing Algorithms, Information Visualization, Multi-dimensional Data
abstract=This paper presents the creation of a a visual environment for exploring landscape patterns and changes to such patterns over time. Dynamic landscape patterns can involve both spatial and temporal complexity. Exploration of spatio-temporal landscape patterns should provide the ability to view information at dierent scales to permit navigation of a vast amount of information in a manner that facilitates comprehension rather than confusion. One way of achieving this goal is to support selection, navigation and comparison of progressively rened segments of time and space. We have entitled this system Tardis after the time machine of Dr. Who, to emphasize the exploration of time dependent data and because our use of elastic presentation has the eect of providing more internal space than the external volume suggests. Of special concern in this research is the extent of the data and its inter-relationships that need to be understood over multiple scales, and the challenge inherent in implementing viewing methods to facilitate understanding

abstract=A user study was conducted to investigate how people deal with the flow of information in their workspaces. Subjects reported that, in an attempt to quickly and informally manage their information, they created piles of documents. Piles were seen as complementary to the folder filing system, which was used for more formal archiving. A new desktop interface element–the pile– was developed and prototyped through an iterative process. The design includes direct manipulation techniques and support for browsing, and goes beyond physical world functionality by providing system assistance for automatic pile construction and reorganization. Preliminary user tests indicate the design is promising and raise issues that will be addressed in future work.

title=FaST Sliders: Integrating marking menus and the adjustment of continuous values. Graphics Interface
booktitle=GI 2002 Conference Proceedings
year=2002
abstract=We propose a technique, called FaST Sliders, for selecting and adjusting continuous values using a fast, transient interaction much like pop-up menus. FaST Sliders combine marking menus and graphical sliders in a design that allows operation with quick ballistic movements for selection and coarse adjustment. Furthermore, additional controls can be displayed within the same interaction, for fine adjustments or other functions. We describe the design of FaST Sliders and a user study comparing FaST Sliders to other transient techniques. The results of our user study indicate that FaST Sliders hold potential. We observed that users found FaST Slider easy to learn and made use of and preferred its affordances for ballistic movement and additional controls.

numpages=8
keywords=3D model exploration, expanding annotations, explosion diagram, interaction design
abstract=Understanding complex 3D virtual models can be difficult, especially when the model has interior components not initially visible and ancillary text. We describe new techniques for the interactive exploration of 3D models. Specifically, in addition to traditional viewing operations, we present new text extrusion techniques combined with techniques that create an interactive explosion diagram. In our approach, scrollable text annotations that are associated with the various parts of the model can be revealed dynamically, either in part or in full, by moving the mouse cursor within annotation trigger areas. Strong visual connections between model parts and the associated text are included in order to aid comprehension. Furthermore, the model parts can be separated, creating interactive explosion diagrams. Using a 3D probe, occluding objects can be interactively moved apart and then returned to their initial locations. Displayed annotations are kept readable despite model manipulations. Hence, our techniques provide textual context within the spatial context of the 3D model.

abstract=Computer display system users must integrate data across successive displays. This problem of across-display processing is analogous to the question of how the visual system combines data across successive glances (fixations). Research from cognitive psychology on the latter question is used in order to formulate guidelines for the display designer. The result is a new principle of person-computer interaction, visual momentum, which captures knowledge about the mechanisms that support the identification of “relevant” data in human perception so that display system design can support an effective distribution of user attention. The negative consequences of low visual momentum on user performance are described, and display design techniques are presented to improve user across-display information extraction.

An animated motion is then created for the character by drawing a continuous sequence of lines, arcs, and loops. These are parsed and mapped to a parameterized set of output motions that further reflect the location and timing of the input sketch. The current system supports a repertoire of 18 different types of motions in 2D and a subset of these in 3D. The system is unique in its use of a cursive motion specification, its ability to allow for fast experimentation, and its ease of use for non-experts.

abstract=We describe a technique that supports the previewing of navigation, exploration, and editing operations by providing convenient Undo for unsuccessful and/or undesirable actions on multi-level input devices such as touch screens and pen-based computers. By adding a Glimpse state to traditional three-state pressure sensitive input devices, users are able to preview the effects of their editing without committing to them. From this Glimpse state, users can undo their action as easily as they can commit to it, making Glimpse most appropriate for systems in which the user is likely to try out many variations of an edit before finding the right one. Exploration is encouraged as the cumbersome returning to a menu or keyboard to issue an Undo command is eliminated. Glimpse has the added benefits that the negative effects of inconsistencies in the Undo feature within an application are reduced.

abstract=A marking menu allows a user to perform a menu selection by either popping-up a radial (or pie) menu, or by making a straight mark in the direction of the desired menu item without popping-up the menu. A hierarchic marking menu uses hierarchic radial menus and “zig-zag” marks to select from the hierarchy. This paper experimentally investigates the bounds on how many items can be in each level, and how deep the hierarchy can be, before using a marking to select an item becomes too slow or prone to errors.

title=Issues in combining marking and direct manipulation techniques
booktitle=Proceedings of the 4th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology
series=UIST '91
year=1991
numpages=8
abstract=The direct manipulation paradigm has been effective in helping designers create easy to use mouse and keyboard based interfaces. The development of flat display surfaces and transparent tablets are now making possible interfaces where a user can write directly on the screen using a special stylus. The intention of these types of interfaces is to exploit user’s existing handwriting, mark-up and drawing skills while also providing the benefits of direct manipulation. This paper reports on a test bed program which we are using for exploring hand-marking types of interactions and their integration with direct manipulation interactions.

title=Using deformations for browsing volumetric data
year=2003
abstract=Many traditional techniques for "looking inside" volumetric data involve removing portions of the data, for example using various cutting tools, to reveal the interior. This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, "in place" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.

abstract=We propose a new type of contextual pop-up menu called a control menu. These menus combine the selection of an operation and the control of this operation. They integrate up to two scroll bars or spin-boxes and thus allow users to keep their attention focused on the menu during the operation. Control menus can have sub-menus, and also retain the novice and expert modes of use found in marking menus. We describe control menus and how they are useful in different types of user interfaces. A program incorporating our control menus can be tested at http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/zomit/.

keywords=isometric input, pen-based interfaces, pressure input, pressure widgets
abstract=Current user interface widgets typically assume that the input device can only provide x-y position and binary button press information. Other inputs such as the continuous pressure data provided by styluses on tablets are rarely used. We explore the design space of using the continuous pressure sensing capabilities of styluses to operate multi-state widgets. We present the results of a controlled experiment that investigates human ability to perform discrete target selection tasks by varying a stylus' pressure, with full or partial visual feedback. The experiment also considers different techniques for confirming selection once the target is acquired. Based on the experimental results, we discuss implications for the design of pressure sensitive widgets. A taxonomy of pressure widgets is presented, along with a set of initial concept sketches of various pressure widget designs.

numpages=21

abstract=We explored general issues concerning personal information management by investigating the characteristics of office workers' paper-based information, in an industrial research environment. we examined the reasons people collect paper, types of data they collect, problems encountered in handling paper, and strategies used for processing it. We tested three specific hypotheses in the course of an office move. The greater availability of public digital data along with changes in people's jobs or interests should lead to wholescale discarding of paper data, while preparing for the move. Instead we found workers kept large, highly valued papar archives. We also expected that the major part of people's personal archives would be unique documents. However, only 49% of people's archives were unique documents, the remainder being copies of publicly available data and unread information, and we explore reasons for this. We examined the effects of paper-processing strategies on archive structure. We discovered different paper-processing strategies (filing and piling)that were relatively independent of job type. We predicated that filers' attempted to evaluate and catergorize incoming documents would produce smaller archives that were accessed frequently. Contrary to our predictions, filers amassed more information, and accessed it less frequently than pilers. We argue that filers may engage in premature filing: to clear their workspace, they archives information that later turns out to be of low value. Given the effort involved in organzing data, they are also loath to discard filed information, even when its value is uncertain. We discuss the implications of this research for digital personal information management.

abstract=Making effective use of the available display space has long been a fundamental issue in user interface design. We live in a time of rapid advances in available CPU power and memory. However, the common sizes of our computational display spaces have only minimally increased or in some cases, such as hand held devices, actually decreased. In addition, the size and scope of the information spaces we wish to explore are also expanding. Representing vast amounts of information on our relatively small screens has become increasingly problematic and has been associated with problems in navigation, interpretation and recognition. User interface research has proposed several differing presentation approaches to address these problems. These methods create displays that vary considerably, visually and algorithmically. We present a unified framework that provides a way of relating seemingly distinct methods, facilitating the inclusion of more than one presentation method in a single interface. Furthermore, it supports extrapolation between the presentation methods it describes. Of particular interest are the presentation possibilities that exist in the ranges between various distortion presentations, magnified insets and detail-in-context presentations, and between detail-in-context presentations and a full-zooming environment. This unified framework offers a geometric presentation library in which presentation variations are available independently of the mode of graphic representation. The intention is to promote the ease of exploration and experimentation into the use of varied presentation combinations.

title=Animation: from cartoons to the user interface
booktitle=Proceedings of the 6th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology

year=1993
numpages=11
keywords=Self, animation, cartoons, motion blur, user interfaces
abstract=User interfaces are often based on static presentations, a model ill suited for conveying change. Consequently, events on the screen frequently startle and confuse users. Cartoon animation, in contrast, is exceedingly successful at engaging its audience; even the most bizarre events are easily comprehended. The Self user interface has served as a testbed for the application of cartoon animation techniques as a means of making the interface easier to understand and more pleasant to use. Attention to timing and transient detail allows Self objects to move solidly. Use of cartoon-style motion blur allows Self objects to move quickly and still maintain their comprehensibility. Self objects arrive and depart smoothly, without sudden materializations and disappearances, and they rise to the front of overlapping objects smoothly through the use of dissolve. Anticipating motion with a small contrary motion and pacing the middle of transitions faster than the endpoints results in smoother and clearer movements. Despite the differences between user interfaces and cartoons --cartoons are frivolous, passive entertainment and user interfaces are serious, interactive tools -- cartoon animation has much to lend to user interfaces to realize both affective and cognitive benefits. *This work was originally supported by Sun Microsystems Laboratories, an NSF Graduate Fellowship, National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Grant #CCR-8657631, IBM Powell Foundation, Apple Computer, Inc., Cray Laboratories, Tandem, NCR Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., and Digital Equipment Corporation.

title=The Contribution of Thumbnail Image, Mouse-over Text and Spatial Location Memory to Web Page Retrieval in 3D
booktitle= 
year=1999
abstract=We present an empirical evaluation of the contribution of pictorial image and spatial location information on the retrieval of previously stored web pages. Subjects were given 100 snapshots of web pages that they stored in spatial locations on an inclined plane in a desktop 3D environment (Data Mountain). We had them return and try to retrieve their pages again, using a variety of retrieval cues. Even though users had not seen their web page layout for several months, their retrieval times were not significantly slower. In addition, on half of the trials, stored pages were not presented as thumbnail images of the web pages but as blank icons. Taking the pictorial thumbnail images away initially led to a significant drop in subjects’ ability to find the pages, although within a short period of time subjects were able to find the pages equally fast without the thumbnail information. These results indicate that the use of 3D visualization techniques such as those described in this paper can lead to improved user memory for where favorite or frequently used information is stored in an electronic environment.

numpages=4
keywords=real-time animated user interfaces, 3D simulation of paper fliers, digital bulletin boards
abstract=We describe a novel interface for presenting interactive content on public digital bulletin boards.  Inspired by paper fliers on physical bulletin boards, bosted content is displayed using 3D virtual fliers attached to a virtual corkboard by virtual corkboard by virtual pushpins.  Fliers appear in different orientations, creating an attractive informal look, and have autonomous behaviours like fluttering in the wind.  Passers-by can rotate, move and fold fliers; they can also interact with fliers' live content.  Flier content is streamed from a server and represented by the system on large screen displays using a real-time cloth simulation algorithm.  We describe our prototype and offer the results of an initial evaluative user study.

abstract=As interest in usable security spreads, the use of visual approaches in which the functioning of a distributed system is made visually available to end users is an approach that a number of researchers have examined. In this paper, we discuss the use of the social navigation paradigm as a way of organizing visual displays of system action. Drawing on a previous study of security in the Kazaa peer to peer system, we present some examples of the ways in which social navigation can be incorporated in support of usable security.

The fold-and-drop technique presented here offers a natural and efficient way of performing those tasks. We show how this technique successfully builds upon several interaction paradigms previously described, while shedding new light on them.
