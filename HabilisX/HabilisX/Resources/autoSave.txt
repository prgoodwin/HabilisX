abstract=A marking menu allows a user to perform a menu selection by either popping-up a radial (or pie) menu, or by making a straight mark in the direction of the desired menu item without popping-up the menu. A hierarchic marking menu uses hierarchic radial menus and “zig-zag” marks to select from the hierarchy. This paper experimentally investigates the bounds on how many items can be in each level, and how deep the hierarchy can be, before using a marking to select an item becomes too slow or prone to errors.

abstract=Computer display system users must integrate data across successive displays. This problem of across-display processing is analogous to the question of how the visual system combines data across successive glances (fixations). Research from cognitive psychology on the latter question is used in order to formulate guidelines for the display designer. The result is a new principle of person-computer interaction, visual momentum, which captures knowledge about the mechanisms that support the identification of “relevant” data in human perception so that display system design can support an effective distribution of user attention. The negative consequences of low visual momentum on user performance are described, and display design techniques are presented to improve user across-display information extraction.

title=Using deformations for browsing volumetric data
year=2003
abstract=Many traditional techniques for "looking inside" volumetric data involve removing portions of the data, for example using various cutting tools, to reveal the interior. This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, "in place" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.

abstract=We describe a novel interface for presenting interactive content on public digital bulletin boards.  Inspired by paper fliers on physical bulletin boards, bosted content is displayed using 3D virtual fliers attached to a virtual corkboard by virtual corkboard by virtual pushpins.  Fliers appear in different orientations, creating an attractive informal look, and have autonomous behaviours like fluttering in the wind.  Passers-by can rotate, move and fold fliers; they can also interact with fliers' live content.  Flier content is streamed from a server and represented by the system on large screen displays using a real-time cloth simulation algorithm.  We describe our prototype and offer the results of an initial evaluative user study.

abstract=We have witnessed great interest and a wealth of promise in content-based image retrieval as an emerging technology. While the last decade laid foundation to such promise, it also paved the way for a large number of new techniques and systems, got many new people involved, and triggered stronger association of weakly related fields. In this article, we survey almost 300 key theoretical and empirical contributions in the current decade related to image retrieval and automatic image annotation, and in the process discuss the spawning of related subfields. We also discuss significant challenges involved in the adaptation of existing image retrieval techniques to build systems that can be useful in the real world. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for image retrieval research.

title=Animation: from cartoons to the user interface
booktitle=Proceedings of the 6th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology
series=UIST '93
year=1993
numpages=11
keywords=Self, animation, cartoons, motion blur, user interfaces
abstract=User interfaces are often based on static presentations, a model ill suited for conveying change. Consequently, events on the screen frequently startle and confuse users. Cartoon animation, in contrast, is exceedingly successful at engaging its audience; even the most bizarre events are easily comprehended. The Self user interface has served as a testbed for the application of cartoon animation techniques as a means of making the interface easier to understand and more pleasant to use. Attention to timing and transient detail allows Self objects to move solidly. Use of cartoon-style motion blur allows Self objects to move quickly and still maintain their comprehensibility. Self objects arrive and depart smoothly, without sudden materializations and disappearances, and they rise to the front of overlapping objects smoothly through the use of dissolve. Anticipating motion with a small contrary motion and pacing the middle of transitions faster than the endpoints results in smoother and clearer movements. Despite the differences between user interfaces and cartoons --cartoons are frivolous, passive entertainment and user interfaces are serious, interactive tools -- cartoon animation has much to lend to user interfaces to realize both affective and cognitive benefits. *This work was originally supported by Sun Microsystems Laboratories, an NSF Graduate Fellowship, National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Grant #CCR-8657631, IBM Powell Foundation, Apple Computer, Inc., Cray Laboratories, Tandem, NCR Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., and Digital Equipment Corporation.

journal=Personal Ubiquitous Comput.
issue_date=January 2005

year=2005
numpages=20
keywords=Information management, Personal information spaces, Visualisation
abstract=Users’ personal information spaces are characterized by their content, organisation, and ongoing user interaction with them. They are fluid entities, evolving over time, and supporting multiple user activities that may require different perspectives of the same underlying information structure. Increasing storage capacity of computing devices and ready access to networked resources puts users at risk of information overload, and presents increasing challenges in organising and accessing their information. The hierarchical model of information organisation currently dominates personal computing, and is realised for the user in interfaces that help to manage and access filestore hierarchies. Such a model provides limited inherent support for what users do—carry out a range of interleaved activities over time. In this paper, we describe the TimeSpace system, which provides perspectives on a user’s information resources based on activities and temporal attributes of the information. TimeSpace can be used alongside, or in place of, existing systems and models (such as the Microsoft Windows hierarchical file model). User interaction with an information space is non-intrusively observed and then represented automatically in TimeSpace. Visualisations provide overviews of user activity on multiple projects and detailed views of activity within particular projects, allowing navigation forward and backward in time. An observational study of use of the system revealed positive user views of the utility of temporal, activity-oriented workspaces in real world contexts alongside existing tools. Participants appreciated being offered a different perspective on their electronic information collection, one that visually shows the composition and development of their information space. They were interested in using the system for current and long-term work as well as for archiving information, as the visualisations provide a context for their work and give an overview of all their work in progress. The ideas embodied by the system and its visualisations show promise and raise a number of issues for further exploration. In future work, these ideas will be adapted and extended to support users in managing their information spaces across multiple personal devices, locations and time.

title=The Tardis: A Visual Exploration Environment for Landscape Dynamics
year=1999
keywords=Multi-scale Views, Detail-in-Context, Viewing Algorithms, Information Visualization, Multi-dimensional Data
abstract=This paper presents the creation of a a visual environment for exploring landscape patterns and changes to such patterns over time. Dynamic landscape patterns can involve both spatial and temporal complexity. Exploration of spatio-temporal landscape patterns should provide the ability to view information at dierent scales to permit navigation of a vast amount of information in a manner that facilitates comprehension rather than confusion. One way of achieving this goal is to support selection, navigation and comparison of progressively rened segments of time and space. We have entitled this system Tardis after the time machine of Dr. Who, to emphasize the exploration of time dependent data and because our use of elastic presentation has the eect of providing more internal space than the external volume suggests. Of special concern in this research is the extent of the data and its inter-relationships that need to be understood over multiple scales, and the challenge inherent in implementing viewing methods to facilitate understanding

abstract=This paper analyses the character of usability criteria found in lists, which are used for interface design and evaluation. In order to understand usability criteria and relations between different criteria, a categorization of six usability criteria lists has been performed. The analysis has shown that the formulations of criteria reside on different abstraction levels. The results consist of two knowledge contribution. The first contribution is a hierarchical categorization model. The role of this multilevel abstraction hierarchy is to support practical problem solving processes by enabling and supporting the explicit articulation of criteria for a given context. The second contribution is a categorization of usability criteria. The aim of this categorization is to support the understanding of how different usability criteria relate (e.g. overlap or complement) to each other and highlight possible gaps.

year=2005
keywords=collaboration, collaborative work, human-computer interaction, industrial environment, interaction design, mobile devices, prototyping, user experience
abstract=This paper presents the design of a collaborative interface for highly automated, industrial environments. The resulting system, the ABB Powerwall, consists of large, shared interactive displays and several personal mobile information technology devices. On-site service technicians can seamlessly move information back and forth from their mobile devices to the shared display. The system supports various kinds of collaborative work, including making annotations; browsing for information; and visualizing blueprints and three-dimensional representations of products and torrents.The design vision has been to provide end users with an unobtrusive way of sharing information, discussing problems and issues with others in front of a large collaborative screen, and the chance of socializing and learning from each other. Located strategically in the specific environment for which it has been designed, the ABB Powerwall is intended to become a natural gathering point that increases interaction, afford gathering, discussions, collaboration, small talk, socializing, and community-making.

title=An introduction to physically based modeling: particle system dynamics
booktitle=SIGGRAPH Course Notes
series=SIGGRAPH Course Notes '97
year=1997
abstract=Physically based modeling has become an important new approach to computer animation and computer graphics modeling. Although physically based modeling is inherently a mathematical subject, the math involved needn’t be any more difficult nor esoteric than the math that underlies many other areas of computer graphics, such as ray tracing or surface modeling. Many papers on the subject have presupposed a specialized mathematical background that many members of the computer graphics community lack. Consequently, many capable computer graphics practitioners, despite their interest in the subject, have simply been put off by the density of the math. This course addresses the need to make the principles and methods of physically based modeling accessible to a broader computer graphics audience—those who are familiar with mainstream computer graphics and have the usual basic computer graphics math, such as vector/matrix manipulations, but whose first year calculus course may be only dimly remem-bered. Course topics include modeling the dynamics of particle systems and rigid bodies, basic numerical methods for differential equations, simulation of deformable surfaces, collision detection, modeling energy functions and hard constraints, and the dynamics of collision and contact.

The object of this study is to examine users' needs, expectations and requirements for mobile 3D television and video. We conducted three user studies applying triangulation methodology of the extensive survey, focus groups and probe studies to identify the requirements. The results are presented in the form of guidelines which highlight the characteristics of users, the system and service required including what content is interesting and the context in which it will be used. Both academia and industry can benefit from knowledge of these requirements when designing the further studies and development work concerning the user experience of 3D television and video.

abstract=Several techniques have been proposed to support user navigation of large information spaces (e.g., maps or web pages) on small-screen devices such as PDAs and Smartphones. In this paper, we present the results of an evaluation that compared three of these techniques to determine how they might affect performance and satisfaction of users. Two of the techniques are quite common on mobile devices: the first one (DoubleScrollbar) is the standard combination of two scrollbars for separate horizontal and vertical scrolling with zoom buttons to change the scale of the information space, the second one (Grab&Drag) enables users to navigate the information space by directly dragging its currently displayed portion, while zooming is handled through a slider control. The last technique (Zoom-Enhanced Navigator or ZEN) is an extension and adaptation to mobile screens of Overview&Detail approaches, which are based on displaying an overview of the information space together with a detail view of a portion of that space. In these approaches, navigation is usually supported by (i) highlighting in the overview which portion of space is displayed in the detail view, and (ii) allowing users to move the highlight within the overview area to change the corresponding portion of space in the detail area. Our experimental evaluation concerned tasks involving maps as well as web page navigation. The paper analyzes in detail the obtained results in terms of task completion times, number and duration of user interface actions, accuracy of the gained spatial knowledge, and subjective preferences.

abstract=Current user interfaces to complex systems suffer from data displays which are increasingly cumbersome since the representation techniques exceed the human's perceptual capacity to efficiently interpret them. New display dimensions are required to support the user in integrating and relating information across displays and representations. Advances in technology have made animation a viable alternative. Motion holds promise as a perceptually rich and efficient display dimension but little is known about its properties for information display. We summarize types of movement characterization from diverse disciplines and proposes an initial taxonomy of motion properties and application to serve as a framework for further empirical investigation into motion as a useful display dimension

Compared with traditional desktop computers, these mobile devices have distinct limitations, including tiny displays, scarce computing hardware resources, bandwidth fluctuations, ad-hoc communications, voluntary, and involuntary disconnections, etc., presenting new challenges to human-computer interaction on mobile devices. In this paper, we survey research efforts done on mobile device user interface design. Some recently developed techniques for diverse information presentation via visual, audio, and tactile channels are reported. We also brief on our experiences in virtually presenting database query results on PDAs, including both presentation style and presentation content.

abstract=The study of intelligent user interfaces and user modeling and adaptation is well suited for augmenting educational visits to museums. We have defined a novel integrated framework for museum visits and claim that such a framework is essential in such a vast domain that inherently implies complex interactivity. We found that it requires a significant investment in software and hardware infrastructure, design and implementation of intelligent interfaces, and a systematic and iterative evaluation of the design and functionality of user interfaces, involving actual visitors at every stage. We defined and built a suite of interactive and user-adaptive technologies for museum visitors, which was then evaluated at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy: (1) animated agents that help motivate visitors and focus their attention when necessary, (2) automatically generated, adaptive video documentaries on mobile devices, and (3) automatically generated post-visit summaries that reflect the individual interests of visitors as determined by their behavior and choices during their visit. These components are supported by underlying user modeling and inference mechanisms that allow for adaptivity and personalization. Novel software infrastructure allows for agent connectivity and fusion of multiple positioning data streams in the museum space. We conducted several experiments, focusing on various aspects of PEACH. In one, conducted with 110 visitors, we found evidence that even older users are comfortable interacting with a major component of the system.

year=2005
numpages=14
keywords=mobility, remote display, thin-client computing, virtualization
abstract=Rapid improvements in network bandwidth, cost, and ubiquity combined with the security hazards and high total cost of ownership of personal computers have created a growing market for thin-client computing. We introduce THINC, a virtual display architecture for high-performance thin-client computing in both LAN and WAN environments. THINC virtualizes the display at the device driver interface to transparently intercept application display commands and translate them into a few simple low-level commands that can be easily supported by widely used client hardware. THINC's translation mechanism efficiently leverages display semantic information through novel optimizations such as offscreen drawing awareness, native video support, and server-side screen scaling. This is integrated with an update delivery architecture that uses shortest command first scheduling and non-blocking operation. THINC leverages existing display system functionality and works seamlessly with unmodified applications, window systems, and operating systems.We have implemented THINC in an X/Linux environment and compared its performance against widely used commercial approaches, including Citrix MetaFrame, Microsoft RDP, GoToMyPC, X, NX, VNC, and Sun Ray. Our experimental results on web and audio/video applications demonstrate that THINC can provide up to 4.8 times faster web browsing performance and two orders of magnitude better audio/video performance. THINC is the only thin client capable of transparently playing full-screen video and audio at full frame rate in both LAN and WAN environments. Our results also show for the first time that thin clients can even provide good performance using remote clients located in other countries around the world.

An important aspect of context-awareness is to present the current context to the user. We propose a model for visualizing contextual information on the mobile terminal screen. The model is a refinement of a well-known visualization reference model; it takes into account the specific characteristics of mobile use and context information. We present the design of the model in detail, and discuss its applicability for a variety of contexts and tasks by providing a full-fledged use case.

title=Visualizing locations of off-screen objects on mobile devices: a comparative evaluation of three approaches
booktitle=Proceedings of the 8th conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services
series=MobileHCI '06
year=2006
numpages=8
keywords=maps, mobile devices, off-screen locations, visualization
abstract=Browsing large information spaces such as maps on the limited screen of mobile devices often requires people to perform panning and zooming operations that move relevant display content off-screen. This makes it difficult to perform spatial tasks such as finding the location of Points Of Interest (POIs) in a city. Visualizing the location of off-screen objects can mitigate this problem: in this paper, we present a user study comparing the Halo [2] approach with two other techniques based on arrows. Halo surrounds off-screen objects with circles that reach the display window, so that users can derive the location and distance of objects by observing the visible portion of the corresponding circles. In the two arrow-based techniques, arrows point at objects and their size and body length, respectively, inform about the distance of objects. Our study involved four tasks requiring users to identify and compare off-screen objects locations, and also investigated the effectiveness of the three techniques with respect to the number of off-screen objects. Arrows allowed users to order off-screen objects faster and more accurately according to their distance, while Halo allowed users to better identify the correct location of off-screen objects. Implications of these results for mobile map-based applications are also discussed.

abstract=Visualising map-based data on mobile devices presents many challenges. Small displays, comparatively slow hardware and awkward interaction techniques all combine to make mobile map-based visualisations difficult to design and often frustrating to use. Existing mobile visualisation techniques do not adequately address these problems. Adaptive user interfaces, which adapt to the individual characteristics of the user, are proposed as an alternative approach to improve mobile map-based visualisation (MMV) systems. A model is presented which incorporates an adaptive user interface into the design of MMV systems. A prototype MMV system, called MediaMaps, is then described, demonstrating the successful implementation of this model. The results of an evaluation of MediaMaps are then presented, showing its effectiveness in supporting user needs and requirements for MMV using an adaptive user interface.

title=Does animation in user interfaces improve decision making?

numpages=8
keywords=animation, decision making
abstract=This paper reports a laboratory experiment that investigated the relative effects of images, transitions, and interactivity styles used in animated interfaces in two decision making domains. Interfaces used either realistic or abstract images, smooth or abrupt transitions, and parallel or sequential interactivity. Results suggest that decision making performance is influenced by the task domain, the user experience, the image, transition, and interactivity styles used in animated interfaces. Subjects performed better with animated interfaces based on realistic rather than abstract images. Subjects were more accurate with smooth rather than abrupt animation. Subjects were more accurate and enjoyed more the animation with parallel rather than sequential interactivity. Implications on the design of animated interfaces for decision making are provided.

title=FaST Sliders: Integrating marking menus and the adjustment of continuous values. Graphics Interface
booktitle=GI 2002 Conference Proceedings
year=2002
abstract=We propose a technique, called FaST Sliders, for selecting and adjusting continuous values using a fast, transient interaction much like pop-up menus. FaST Sliders combine marking menus and graphical sliders in a design that allows operation with quick ballistic movements for selection and coarse adjustment. Furthermore, additional controls can be displayed within the same interaction, for fine adjustments or other functions. We describe the design of FaST Sliders and a user study comparing FaST Sliders to other transient techniques. The results of our user study indicate that FaST Sliders hold potential. We observed that users found FaST Slider easy to learn and made use of and preferred its affordances for ballistic movement and additional controls.

abstract=The small screen size of handheld mobile devices poses an inherent problem in visualizing data: very often it is too difficult and unpleasant to navigate through the plethora of presented information. This paper presents a novel approach to personalized and adaptive content presentation for handheld devices, which has been implemented in a mobile financial application system based on a 3-tier architecture. The approach is independent of wireless networks and mobile devices. It utilizes a combination of user profiling, data clustering, and visualization techniques (fisheye and semantic zooming), enhancing the understandability of the data and improving the usability of the device.

abstract=The task of managing and accessing large information spaces is a problem in large scale cognition.  Emerging technologies for 3D visualization and interactive animation offer potential solutions to this problem, especially when the structure of the information can be visualized.  We describe one of tehse Information Visualization techniques, called the Cone Tree, which is used for visualizing hierarchical information structures.  The hierarchy is preseneted in 3D to meximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure.  Interactive animation is used to shift some of the user's cognitive load to the human perceptual system.

abstract=Making effective use of the available display space has long been a fundamental issue in user interface design. We live in a time of rapid advances in available CPU power and memory. However, the common sizes of our computational display spaces have only minimally increased or in some cases, such as hand held devices, actually decreased. In addition, the size and scope of the information spaces we wish to explore are also expanding. Representing vast amounts of information on our relatively small screens has become increasingly problematic and has been associated with problems in navigation, interpretation and recognition. User interface research has proposed several differing presentation approaches to address these problems. These methods create displays that vary considerably, visually and algorithmically. We present a unified framework that provides a way of relating seemingly distinct methods, facilitating the inclusion of more than one presentation method in a single interface. Furthermore, it supports extrapolation between the presentation methods it describes. Of particular interest are the presentation possibilities that exist in the ranges between various distortion presentations, magnified insets and detail-in-context presentations, and between detail-in-context presentations and a full-zooming environment. This unified framework offers a geometric presentation library in which presentation variations are available independently of the mode of graphic representation. The intention is to promote the ease of exploration and experimentation into the use of varied presentation combinations.

title=The design and development of user interfaces for small screen computers
year=2003
note=AAI3098862
abstract=The increasing availability of small size computers, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Palm pilots or handheld devices, with the ability to transmit information over wireless networks has enormously enhanced opportunities for researchers. However, these devices have difficulty displaying information because of their hardware constraints, such as small screens, small storage, low speed, and low power. This thesis introduces two methods for solving these problems. First, providing zoomable user interfaces (ZUI) introduces many zooming applications such as a file zoom, a focus zoom, and a search zoom which are based on geometric and semantic zooming methods. The file zooming applications use dynamic zoom-in and zoom-out functions for visualizing large amounts of information on the PDA screen. The focus zooming applications are based on a magnifying glass lens that is a 2D visualization for large rectangular presentations that allows a user to quickly focus on a part of the PDA screen. Finally, the thesis describes the search zooming applications for easy recognition and comparison of the content of files on the screen.  With the proliferation of PDAs, people are using such small devices to access the web; however, the web is not accommodating such access. For small device users, we introduce adaptive user interfaces (AUI) based on an efficient method for extracting readable documents from XML-based files, which will be used for information streams for mobile Internet access. We design a selector for handling information streams to extract the customized information based on the user request for the small devices. The selector's attributes can be adapted from the XML documents, and then works on translating information streams into the new file that will be displayed on the devices. Also, the selector has visual menu interfaces so that users can easily choose each attribute according to their preferences. This is developed to devise an efficient method for the small devices' problems.  Furthermore, we prepare usability testing for the applications in order to find usability problems, and then we offer suggestions for improving the usability of the applications. The prototypes and implementations of these approaches will be also provided in this thesis

numpages=8
keywords=3D model exploration, expanding annotations, explosion diagram, interaction design
abstract=Understanding complex 3D virtual models can be difficult, especially when the model has interior components not initially visible and ancillary text. We describe new techniques for the interactive exploration of 3D models. Specifically, in addition to traditional viewing operations, we present new text extrusion techniques combined with techniques that create an interactive explosion diagram. In our approach, scrollable text annotations that are associated with the various parts of the model can be revealed dynamically, either in part or in full, by moving the mouse cursor within annotation trigger areas. Strong visual connections between model parts and the associated text are included in order to aid comprehension. Furthermore, the model parts can be separated, creating interactive explosion diagrams. Using a 3D probe, occluding objects can be interactively moved apart and then returned to their initial locations. Displayed annotations are kept readable despite model manipulations. Hence, our techniques provide textual context within the spatial context of the 3D model.

abstract=“The desktop is dead,” declares David Gelernter. Gelernter is referring to the “desktop metaphor”-the term frequently used for the hierarchical system of files, folders and icons that we use to manage information stored on our home or office computers. At the annual gathering of technophiles at TechXNY/PC Expo 2001 in New York last June, he told the rapt crowd attending his keynote speech that the desktop metaphor is nothing more than virtual Tupperware. “Our electronic documents are scattered by the thousands in all sorts of little containers all over the place,” he said. “The more information and the more computers in our lives, the more of a nuisance this system becomes.”

Its design is based on an integration of information and architectural spaces, implications of new work practices and an empirical requirements study informing our design. i-LAND consists of several roomware components, i.e. computer-aug- mented objects integrating room elements with information technology. We present the current realization of i-LAND in terms of an interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, two computer-enhanced chairs, and two bridges for the Passage-mechanism. This is complemented by the description of the creativity support application and the technological infrastructure. The paper is accompanied by a video figure in the CHI99 video program.

For Web publishing, however, there are many resources to look for guidelines. The guidelines can be classified according to which aspect of the Web media they are related: software/hardware, content and its organization, or aesthetics and layout. In order to be applicable to PDA services, these guidelines have to be modified. In this paper we analyze the main characteristics of PDAs and their influence to the guidelines.
