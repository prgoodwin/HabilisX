abstract = {Current user interfaces to complex systems suffer from data displays which are increasingly cumbersome since the representation techniques exceed the human's perceptual capacity to efficiently interpret them. New display dimensions are required to support the user in integrating and relating information across displays and representations. Advances in technology have made animation a viable alternative. Motion holds promise as a perceptually rich and efficient display dimension but little is known about its properties for information display. We summarize types of movement characterization from diverse disciplines and proposes an initial taxonomy of motion properties and application to serve as a framework for further empirical investigation into motion as a useful display dimension},

abstract = {Making effective use of the available display space has long been a fundamental issue in user interface design. We live in a time of rapid advances in available CPU power and memory. However, the common sizes of our computational display spaces have only minimally increased or in some cases, such as hand held devices, actually decreased. In addition, the size and scope of the information spaces we wish to explore are also expanding. Representing vast amounts of information on our relatively small screens has become increasingly problematic and has been associated with problems in navigation, interpretation and recognition. User interface research has proposed several differing presentation approaches to address these problems. These methods create displays that vary considerably, visually and algorithmically. We present a unified framework that provides a way of relating seemingly distinct methods, facilitating the inclusion of more than one presentation method in a single interface. Furthermore, it supports extrapolation between the presentation methods it describes. Of particular interest are the presentation possibilities that exist in the ranges between various distortion presentations, magnified insets and detail-in-context presentations, and between detail-in-context presentations and a full-zooming environment. This unified framework offers a geometric presentation library in which presentation variations are available independently of the mode of graphic representation. The intention is to promote the ease of exploration and experimentation into the use of varied presentation combinations.},

abstract = {User interfaces are often based on static presentations, a model ill suited for conveying change. Consequently, events on the screen frequently startle and confuse users. Cartoon animation, in contrast, is exceedingly successful at engaging its audience; even the most bizarre events are easily comprehended. The Self user interface has served as a testbed for the application of cartoon animation techniques as a means of making the interface easier to understand and more pleasant to use. Attention to timing and transient detail allows Self objects to move solidly. Use of cartoon-style motion blur allows Self objects to move quickly and still maintain their comprehensibility. Self objects arrive and depart smoothly, without sudden materializations and disappearances, and they rise to the front of overlapping objects smoothly through the use of dissolve. Anticipating motion with a small contrary motion and pacing the middle of transitions faster than the endpoints results in smoother and clearer movements. Despite the differences between user interfaces and cartoons --cartoons are frivolous, passive entertainment and user interfaces are serious, interactive tools -- cartoon animation has much to lend to user interfaces to realize both affective and cognitive benefits. *This work was originally supported by Sun Microsystems Laboratories, an NSF Graduate Fellowship, National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Grant \#CCR-8657631, IBM Powell Foundation, Apple Computer, Inc., Cray Laboratories, Tandem, NCR Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., and Digital Equipment Corporation.},

The analysis has shown that the formulations of criteria reside on different abstraction levels. The results consist of two knowledge contribution. The first contribution is a hierarchical categorization model. The role of this multilevel abstraction hierarchy is to support practical problem solving processes by enabling and supporting the explicit articulation of criteria for a given context. The second contribution is a categorization of usability criteria.

Subjects performed better with animated interfaces based on realistic rather than abstract images. Subjects were more accurate with smooth rather than abrupt animation.

We describe new techniques for the interactive exploration of 3D models. Specifically, in addition to traditional viewing operations, we present new text extrusion techniques combined with techniques that create an interactive explosion diagram. In our approach, scrollable text annotations that are associated with the various parts of the model can be revealed dynamically, either in part or in full, by moving the mouse cursor within annotation trigger areas. Strong visual connections between model parts and the associated text are included in order to aid comprehension. Furthermore, the model parts can be separated, creating interactive explosion diagrams. Using a 3D probe, occluding objects can be interactively moved apart and then returned to their initial locations. Displayed annotations are kept readable despite model manipulations. Hence, our techniques provide textual context within the spatial context of the 3D model.},
