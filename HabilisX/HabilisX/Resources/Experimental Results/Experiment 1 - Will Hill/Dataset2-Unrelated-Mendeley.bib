The key points of the demonstration include: requesting multidimensional resource availability information from a smart space and visualizing this information to the user on a personal device, leasing the selected resource for a distributed application launch and utilizing the leased resource to deploy an application for personal media viewing, manipulating and sharing. This application then allows users a 3D sensor-based interaction between their mobile phone and a large public display.},

abstract = {Rapid improvements in network bandwidth, cost, and ubiquity combined with the security hazards and high total cost of ownership of personal computers have created a growing market for thin-client computing. We introduce THINC, a virtual display architecture for high-performance thin-client computing in both LAN and WAN environments. THINC virtualizes the display at the device driver interface to transparently intercept application display commands and translate them into a few simple low-level commands that can be easily supported by widely used client hardware. THINC's translation mechanism efficiently leverages display semantic information through novel optimizations such as offscreen drawing awareness, native video support, and server-side screen scaling. This is integrated with an update delivery architecture that uses shortest command first scheduling and non-blocking operation. THINC leverages existing display system functionality and works seamlessly with unmodified applications, window systems, and operating systems.We have implemented THINC in an X/Linux environment and compared its performance against widely used commercial approaches, including Citrix MetaFrame, Microsoft RDP, GoToMyPC, X, NX, VNC, and Sun Ray. Our experimental results on web and audio/video applications demonstrate that THINC can provide up to 4.8 times faster web browsing performance and two orders of magnitude better audio/video performance. THINC is the only thin client capable of transparently playing full-screen video and audio at full frame rate in both LAN and WAN environments. Our results also show for the first time that thin clients can even provide good performance using remote clients located in other countries around the world.},

Motion holds promise as a perceptually rich and efficient display dimension but little is known about its properties for information display.

abstract = {Visualising map-based data on mobile devices presents many challenges. Small displays, comparatively slow hardware and awkward interaction techniques all combine to make mobile map-based visualisations difficult to design and often frustrating to use. Existing mobile visualisation techniques do not adequately address these problems. Adaptive user interfaces, which adapt to the individual characteristics of the user, are proposed as an alternative approach to improve mobile map-based visualisation (MMV) systems. A model is presented which incorporates an adaptive user interface into the design of MMV systems. A prototype MMV system, called MediaMaps, is then described, demonstrating the successful implementation of this model. The results of an evaluation of MediaMaps are then presented, showing its effectiveness in supporting user needs and requirements for MMV using an adaptive user interface.},

abstract = {Several techniques have been proposed to support user navigation of large information spaces (e.g., maps or web pages) on small-screen devices such as PDAs and Smartphones. In this paper, we present the results of an evaluation that compared three of these techniques to determine how they might affect performance and satisfaction of users. Two of the techniques are quite common on mobile devices: the first one (DoubleScrollbar) is the standard combination of two scrollbars for separate horizontal and vertical scrolling with zoom buttons to change the scale of the information space, the second one (Grab\&Drag) enables users to navigate the information space by directly dragging its currently displayed portion, while zooming is handled through a slider control. The last technique (Zoom-Enhanced Navigator or ZEN) is an extension and adaptation to mobile screens of Overview\&Detail approaches, which are based on displaying an overview of the information space together with a detail view of a portion of that space. In these approaches, navigation is usually supported by (i) highlighting in the overview which portion of space is displayed in the detail view, and (ii) allowing users to move the highlight within the overview area to change the corresponding portion of space in the detail area. Our experimental evaluation concerned tasks involving maps as well as web page navigation. The paper analyzes in detail the obtained results in terms of task completion times, number and duration of user interface actions, accuracy of the gained spatial knowledge, and subjective preferences.},

Although physically based modeling is inherently a mathematical subject, the math involved needn’t be any more difficult nor esoteric than the math that underlies many other areas of computer graphics, such as ray tracing or surface modeling. Many papers on the subject have presupposed a specialized mathematical background that many members of the computer graphics community lack. Consequently, many capable computer graphics practitioners, despite their interest in the subject, have simply been put off by the density of the math. This course addresses the need to make the principles and methods of physically based modeling accessible to a broader computer graphics audience—those who are familiar with mainstream computer graphics and have the usual basic computer graphics math, such as vector/matrix manipulations, but whose first year calculus course may be only dimly remem-bered. Course topics include modeling the dynamics of particle systems and rigid bodies, basic numerical methods for differential equations, simulation of deformable surfaces, collision detection, modeling energy functions and hard constraints, and the dynamics of collision and contact.},

We have defined a novel integrated framework for museum visits and claim that such a framework is essential in such a vast domain that inherently implies complex interactivity. We found that it requires a significant investment in software and hardware infrastructure, design and implementation of intelligent interfaces, and a systematic and iterative evaluation of the design and functionality of user interfaces, involving actual visitors at every stage. We defined and built a suite of interactive and user-adaptive technologies for museum visitors, which was then evaluated at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy: (1) animated agents that help motivate visitors and focus their attention when necessary, (2) automatically generated, adaptive video documentaries on mobile devices, and (3) automatically generated post-visit summaries that reflect the individual interests of visitors as determined by their behavior and choices during their visit. These components are supported by underlying user modeling and inference mechanisms that allow for adaptivity and personalization. Novel software infrastructure allows for agent connectivity and fusion of multiple positioning data streams in the museum space. We conducted several experiments, focusing on various aspects of PEACH. In one, conducted with 110 visitors, we found evidence that even older users are comfortable interacting with a major component of the system.},
