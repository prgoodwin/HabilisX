abstract = {Making effective use of the available display space has long been a fundamental issue in user interface design. We live in a time of rapid advances in available CPU power and memory. However, the common sizes of our computational display spaces have only minimally increased or in some cases, such as hand held devices, actually decreased. In addition, the size and scope of the information spaces we wish to explore are also expanding. Representing vast amounts of information on our relatively small screens has become increasingly problematic and has been associated with problems in navigation, interpretation and recognition. User interface research has proposed several differing presentation approaches to address these problems. These methods create displays that vary considerably, visually and algorithmically. We present a unified framework that provides a way of relating seemingly distinct methods, facilitating the inclusion of more than one presentation method in a single interface. Furthermore, it supports extrapolation between the presentation methods it describes. Of particular interest are the presentation possibilities that exist in the ranges between various distortion presentations, magnified insets and detail-in-context presentations, and between detail-in-context presentations and a full-zooming environment. This unified framework offers a geometric presentation library in which presentation variations are available independently of the mode of graphic representation. The intention is to promote the ease of exploration and experimentation into the use of varied presentation combinations.},

abstract = {Users’ personal information spaces are characterized by their content, organisation, and ongoing user interaction with them. They are fluid entities, evolving over time, and supporting multiple user activities that may require different perspectives of the same underlying information structure. Increasing storage capacity of computing devices and ready access to networked resources puts users at risk of information overload, and presents increasing challenges in organising and accessing their information. The hierarchical model of information organisation currently dominates personal computing, and is realised for the user in interfaces that help to manage and access filestore hierarchies. Such a model provides limited inherent support for what users do—carry out a range of interleaved activities over time. In this paper, we describe the TimeSpace system, which provides perspectives on a user’s information resources based on activities and temporal attributes of the information. TimeSpace can be used alongside, or in place of, existing systems and models (such as the Microsoft Windows hierarchical file model). User interaction with an information space is non-intrusively observed and then represented automatically in TimeSpace. Visualisations provide overviews of user activity on multiple projects and detailed views of activity within particular projects, allowing navigation forward and backward in time. An observational study of use of the system revealed positive user views of the utility of temporal, activity-oriented workspaces in real world contexts alongside existing tools. Participants appreciated being offered a different perspective on their electronic information collection, one that visually shows the composition and development of their information space. They were interested in using the system for current and long-term work as well as for archiving information, as the visualisations provide a context for their work and give an overview of all their work in progress. The ideas embodied by the system and its visualisations show promise and raise a number of issues for further exploration. In future work, these ideas will be adapted and extended to support users in managing their information spaces across multiple personal devices, locations and time.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of small size computers, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Palm pilots or handheld devices, with the ability to transmit information over wireless networks has enormously enhanced opportunities for researchers. However, these devices have difficulty displaying information because of their hardware constraints, such as small screens, small storage, low speed, and low power. This thesis introduces two methods for solving these problems. First, providing zoomable user interfaces (ZUI) introduces many zooming applications such as a file zoom, a focus zoom, and a search zoom which are based on geometric and semantic zooming methods. The file zooming applications use dynamic zoom-in and zoom-out functions for visualizing large amounts of information on the PDA screen. The focus zooming applications are based on a magnifying glass lens that is a 2D visualization for large rectangular presentations that allows a user to quickly focus on a part of the PDA screen. Finally, the thesis describes the search zooming applications for easy recognition and comparison of the content of files on the screen. With the proliferation of PDAs, people are using such small devices to access the web; however, the web is not accommodating such access. For small device users, we introduce adaptive user interfaces (AUI) based on an efficient method for extracting readable documents from XML-based files, which will be used for information streams for mobile Internet access. We design a selector for handling information streams to extract the customized information based on the user request for the small devices. The selector's attributes can be adapted from the XML documents, and then works on translating information streams into the new file that will be displayed on the devices. Also, the selector has visual menu interfaces so that users can easily choose each attribute according to their preferences. This is developed to devise an efficient method for the small devices' problems. Furthermore, we prepare usability testing for the applications in order to find usability problems, and then we offer suggestions for improving the usability of the applications. The prototypes and implementations of these approaches will be also provided in this thesis},

abstract = {Many traditional techniques for "looking inside" volumetric data involve removing portions of the data, for example using various cutting tools, to reveal the interior. This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, "in place" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.},

Consequently, many capable computer graphics practitioners, despite their interest in the subject, have simply been put off by the density of the math. This course addresses the need to make the principles and methods of physically based modeling accessible to a broader computer graphics audience—those who are familiar with mainstream computer graphics and have the usual basic computer graphics math, such as vector/matrix manipulations, but whose first year calculus course may be only dimly remem-bered.

abstract = {A long process has been undertaken to develop the technology of 3D video for consumer products, but studies to determine the needs and expectations of actual users have been disregarded. The object of this study is to examine users' needs, expectations and requirements for mobile 3D television and video. We conducted three user studies applying triangulation methodology of the extensive survey, focus groups and probe studies to identify the requirements. The results are presented in the form of guidelines which highlight the characteristics of users, the system and service required including what content is interesting and the context in which it will be used. Both academia and industry can benefit from knowledge of these requirements when designing the further studies and development work concerning the user experience of 3D television and video.},
