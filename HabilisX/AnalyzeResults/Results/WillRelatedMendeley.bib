abstract = {Visualising map-based data on mobile devices presents many challenges. Small displays, comparatively slow hardware and awkward interaction techniques all combine to make mobile map-based visualisations difficult to design and often frustrating to use. Existing mobile visualisation techniques do not adequately address these problems. Adaptive user interfaces, which adapt to the individual characteristics of the user, are proposed as an alternative approach to improve mobile map-based visualisation (MMV) systems. A model is presented which incorporates an adaptive user interface into the design of MMV systems. A prototype MMV system, called MediaMaps, is then described, demonstrating the successful implementation of this model. The results of an evaluation of MediaMaps are then presented, showing its effectiveness in supporting user needs and requirements for MMV using an adaptive user interface.},

abstract = {Many traditional techniques for "looking inside" volumetric data involve removing portions of the data, for example using various cutting tools, to reveal the interior. This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, "in place" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.},

Specifically, in addition to traditional viewing operations, we present new text extrusion techniques combined with techniques that create an interactive explosion diagram. In our approach, scrollable text annotations that are associated with the various parts of the model can be revealed dynamically, either in part or in full, by moving the mouse cursor within annotation trigger areas. Strong visual connections between model parts and the associated text are included in order to aid comprehension. Furthermore, the model parts can be separated, creating interactive explosion diagrams. Using a 3D probe, occluding objects can be interactively moved apart and then returned to their initial locations. Displayed annotations are kept readable despite model manipulations.

abstract = {Several techniques have been proposed to support user navigation of large information spaces (e.g., maps or web pages) on small-screen devices such as PDAs and Smartphones. In this paper, we present the results of an evaluation that compared three of these techniques to determine how they might affect performance and satisfaction of users. Two of the techniques are quite common on mobile devices: the first one (DoubleScrollbar) is the standard combination of two scrollbars for separate horizontal and vertical scrolling with zoom buttons to change the scale of the information space, the second one (Grab\&Drag) enables users to navigate the information space by directly dragging its currently displayed portion, while zooming is handled through a slider control. The last technique (Zoom-Enhanced Navigator or ZEN) is an extension and adaptation to mobile screens of Overview\&Detail approaches, which are based on displaying an overview of the information space together with a detail view of a portion of that space. In these approaches, navigation is usually supported by (i) highlighting in the overview which portion of space is displayed in the detail view, and (ii) allowing users to move the highlight within the overview area to change the corresponding portion of space in the detail area. Our experimental evaluation concerned tasks involving maps as well as web page navigation. The paper analyzes in detail the obtained results in terms of task completion times, number and duration of user interface actions, accuracy of the gained spatial knowledge, and subjective preferences.},

This makes it difficult to perform spatial tasks such as finding the location of Points Of Interest (POIs) in a city. Visualizing the location of off-screen objects can mitigate this problem: in this paper, we present a user study comparing the Halo [2] approach with two other techniques based on arrows. Halo surrounds off-screen objects with circles that reach the display window, so that users can derive the location and distance of objects by observing the visible portion of the corresponding circles. In the two arrow-based techniques, arrows point at objects and their size and body length, respectively, inform about the distance of objects. Our study involved four tasks requiring users to identify and compare off-screen objects locations, and also investigated the effectiveness of the three techniques with respect to the number of off-screen objects. Arrows allowed users to order off-screen objects faster and more accurately according to their distance, while Halo allowed users to better identify the correct location of off-screen objects. Implications of these results for mobile map-based applications are also discussed.},

abstract = {The study of intelligent user interfaces and user modeling and adaptation is well suited for augmenting educational visits to museums. We have defined a novel integrated framework for museum visits and claim that such a framework is essential in such a vast domain that inherently implies complex interactivity. We found that it requires a significant investment in software and hardware infrastructure, design and implementation of intelligent interfaces, and a systematic and iterative evaluation of the design and functionality of user interfaces, involving actual visitors at every stage. We defined and built a suite of interactive and user-adaptive technologies for museum visitors, which was then evaluated at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy: (1) animated agents that help motivate visitors and focus their attention when necessary, (2) automatically generated, adaptive video documentaries on mobile devices, and (3) automatically generated post-visit summaries that reflect the individual interests of visitors as determined by their behavior and choices during their visit. These components are supported by underlying user modeling and inference mechanisms that allow for adaptivity and personalization. Novel software infrastructure allows for agent connectivity and fusion of multiple positioning data streams in the museum space. We conducted several experiments, focusing on various aspects of PEACH. In one, conducted with 110 visitors, we found evidence that even older users are comfortable interacting with a major component of the system.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of small size computers, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Palm pilots or handheld devices, with the ability to transmit information over wireless networks has enormously enhanced opportunities for researchers. However, these devices have difficulty displaying information because of their hardware constraints, such as small screens, small storage, low speed, and low power. This thesis introduces two methods for solving these problems. First, providing zoomable user interfaces (ZUI) introduces many zooming applications such as a file zoom, a focus zoom, and a search zoom which are based on geometric and semantic zooming methods. The file zooming applications use dynamic zoom-in and zoom-out functions for visualizing large amounts of information on the PDA screen. The focus zooming applications are based on a magnifying glass lens that is a 2D visualization for large rectangular presentations that allows a user to quickly focus on a part of the PDA screen. Finally, the thesis describes the search zooming applications for easy recognition and comparison of the content of files on the screen. With the proliferation of PDAs, people are using such small devices to access the web; however, the web is not accommodating such access. For small device users, we introduce adaptive user interfaces (AUI) based on an efficient method for extracting readable documents from XML-based files, which will be used for information streams for mobile Internet access. We design a selector for handling information streams to extract the customized information based on the user request for the small devices. The selector's attributes can be adapted from the XML documents, and then works on translating information streams into the new file that will be displayed on the devices. Also, the selector has visual menu interfaces so that users can easily choose each attribute according to their preferences. This is developed to devise an efficient method for the small devices' problems. Furthermore, we prepare usability testing for the applications in order to find usability problems, and then we offer suggestions for improving the usability of the applications. The prototypes and implementations of these approaches will be also provided in this thesis},

abstract = {User interfaces are often based on static presentations, a model ill suited for conveying change. Consequently, events on the screen frequently startle and confuse users. Cartoon animation, in contrast, is exceedingly successful at engaging its audience; even the most bizarre events are easily comprehended. The Self user interface has served as a testbed for the application of cartoon animation techniques as a means of making the interface easier to understand and more pleasant to use. Attention to timing and transient detail allows Self objects to move solidly. Use of cartoon-style motion blur allows Self objects to move quickly and still maintain their comprehensibility. Self objects arrive and depart smoothly, without sudden materializations and disappearances, and they rise to the front of overlapping objects smoothly through the use of dissolve. Anticipating motion with a small contrary motion and pacing the middle of transitions faster than the endpoints results in smoother and clearer movements. Despite the differences between user interfaces and cartoons --cartoons are frivolous, passive entertainment and user interfaces are serious, interactive tools -- cartoon animation has much to lend to user interfaces to realize both affective and cognitive benefits. *This work was originally supported by Sun Microsystems Laboratories, an NSF Graduate Fellowship, National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Grant \#CCR-8657631, IBM Powell Foundation, Apple Computer, Inc., Cray Laboratories, Tandem, NCR Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., and Digital Equipment Corporation.},

However, the common sizes of our computational display spaces have only minimally increased or in some cases, such as hand held devices, actually decreased. In addition, the size and scope of the information spaces we wish to explore are also expanding. Representing vast amounts of information on our relatively small screens has become increasingly problematic and has been associated with problems in navigation, interpretation and recognition. User interface research has proposed several differing presentation approaches to address these problems. These methods create displays that vary considerably, visually and algorithmically. We present a unified framework that provides a way of relating seemingly distinct methods, facilitating the inclusion of more than one presentation method in a single interface. Furthermore, it supports extrapolation between the presentation methods it describes. Of particular interest are the presentation possibilities that exist in the ranges between various distortion presentations, magnified insets and detail-in-context presentations, and between detail-in-context presentations and a full-zooming environment. This unified framework offers a geometric presentation library in which presentation variations are available independently of the mode of graphic representation. The intention is to promote the ease of exploration and experimentation into the use of varied presentation combinations.},
