abstract = {Context-awareness can be used to decrease the need for interaction with a mobile device. This is increasingly important since the functionality of mobile devices and personal digital assistants gets more and more complex while the input and output capabilities remain restricted. An important aspect of context-awareness is to present the current context to the user. We propose a model for visualizing contextual information on the mobile terminal screen. The model is a refinement of a well-known visualization reference model; it takes into account the specific characteristics of mobile use and context information. We present the design of the model in detail, and discuss its applicability for a variety of contexts and tasks by providing a full-fledged use case.},

abstract = {Browsing large information spaces such as maps on the limited screen of mobile devices often requires people to perform panning and zooming operations that move relevant display content off-screen. This makes it difficult to perform spatial tasks such as finding the location of Points Of Interest (POIs) in a city. Visualizing the location of off-screen objects can mitigate this problem: in this paper, we present a user study comparing the Halo [2] approach with two other techniques based on arrows. Halo surrounds off-screen objects with circles that reach the display window, so that users can derive the location and distance of objects by observing the visible portion of the corresponding circles. In the two arrow-based techniques, arrows point at objects and their size and body length, respectively, inform about the distance of objects. Our study involved four tasks requiring users to identify and compare off-screen objects locations, and also investigated the effectiveness of the three techniques with respect to the number of off-screen objects. Arrows allowed users to order off-screen objects faster and more accurately according to their distance, while Halo allowed users to better identify the correct location of off-screen objects. Implications of these results for mobile map-based applications are also discussed.},

abstract = {Making effective use of the available display space has long been a fundamental issue in user interface design. We live in a time of rapid advances in available CPU power and memory. However, the common sizes of our computational display spaces have only minimally increased or in some cases, such as hand held devices, actually decreased. In addition, the size and scope of the information spaces we wish to explore are also expanding. Representing vast amounts of information on our relatively small screens has become increasingly problematic and has been associated with problems in navigation, interpretation and recognition. User interface research has proposed several differing presentation approaches to address these problems. These methods create displays that vary considerably, visually and algorithmically. We present a unified framework that provides a way of relating seemingly distinct methods, facilitating the inclusion of more than one presentation method in a single interface. Furthermore, it supports extrapolation between the presentation methods it describes. Of particular interest are the presentation possibilities that exist in the ranges between various distortion presentations, magnified insets and detail-in-context presentations, and between detail-in-context presentations and a full-zooming environment. This unified framework offers a geometric presentation library in which presentation variations are available independently of the mode of graphic representation. The intention is to promote the ease of exploration and experimentation into the use of varied presentation combinations.},

abstract = {User interfaces are often based on static presentations, a model ill suited for conveying change. Consequently, events on the screen frequently startle and confuse users. Cartoon animation, in contrast, is exceedingly successful at engaging its audience; even the most bizarre events are easily comprehended. The Self user interface has served as a testbed for the application of cartoon animation techniques as a means of making the interface easier to understand and more pleasant to use. Attention to timing and transient detail allows Self objects to move solidly. Use of cartoon-style motion blur allows Self objects to move quickly and still maintain their comprehensibility. Self objects arrive and depart smoothly, without sudden materializations and disappearances, and they rise to the front of overlapping objects smoothly through the use of dissolve. Anticipating motion with a small contrary motion and pacing the middle of transitions faster than the endpoints results in smoother and clearer movements. Despite the differences between user interfaces and cartoons --cartoons are frivolous, passive entertainment and user interfaces are serious, interactive tools -- cartoon animation has much to lend to user interfaces to realize both affective and cognitive benefits. *This work was originally supported by Sun Microsystems Laboratories, an NSF Graduate Fellowship, National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Grant \#CCR-8657631, IBM Powell Foundation, Apple Computer, Inc., Cray Laboratories, Tandem, NCR Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., and Digital Equipment Corporation.},

abstract = {Users’ personal information spaces are characterized by their content, organisation, and ongoing user interaction with them. They are fluid entities, evolving over time, and supporting multiple user activities that may require different perspectives of the same underlying information structure. Increasing storage capacity of computing devices and ready access to networked resources puts users at risk of information overload, and presents increasing challenges in organising and accessing their information. The hierarchical model of information organisation currently dominates personal computing, and is realised for the user in interfaces that help to manage and access filestore hierarchies. Such a model provides limited inherent support for what users do—carry out a range of interleaved activities over time. In this paper, we describe the TimeSpace system, which provides perspectives on a user’s information resources based on activities and temporal attributes of the information. TimeSpace can be used alongside, or in place of, existing systems and models (such as the Microsoft Windows hierarchical file model). User interaction with an information space is non-intrusively observed and then represented automatically in TimeSpace. Visualisations provide overviews of user activity on multiple projects and detailed views of activity within particular projects, allowing navigation forward and backward in time. An observational study of use of the system revealed positive user views of the utility of temporal, activity-oriented workspaces in real world contexts alongside existing tools. Participants appreciated being offered a different perspective on their electronic information collection, one that visually shows the composition and development of their information space. They were interested in using the system for current and long-term work as well as for archiving information, as the visualisations provide a context for their work and give an overview of all their work in progress. The ideas embodied by the system and its visualisations show promise and raise a number of issues for further exploration. In future work, these ideas will be adapted and extended to support users in managing their information spaces across multiple personal devices, locations and time.},

abstract = {The study of intelligent user interfaces and user modeling and adaptation is well suited for augmenting educational visits to museums. We have defined a novel integrated framework for museum visits and claim that such a framework is essential in such a vast domain that inherently implies complex interactivity. We found that it requires a significant investment in software and hardware infrastructure, design and implementation of intelligent interfaces, and a systematic and iterative evaluation of the design and functionality of user interfaces, involving actual visitors at every stage. We defined and built a suite of interactive and user-adaptive technologies for museum visitors, which was then evaluated at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy: (1) animated agents that help motivate visitors and focus their attention when necessary, (2) automatically generated, adaptive video documentaries on mobile devices, and (3) automatically generated post-visit summaries that reflect the individual interests of visitors as determined by their behavior and choices during their visit. These components are supported by underlying user modeling and inference mechanisms that allow for adaptivity and personalization. Novel software infrastructure allows for agent connectivity and fusion of multiple positioning data streams in the museum space. We conducted several experiments, focusing on various aspects of PEACH. In one, conducted with 110 visitors, we found evidence that even older users are comfortable interacting with a major component of the system.},

Its design is based on an integration of information and architectural spaces, implications of new work practices and an empirical requirements study informing our design. i-LAND consists of several roomware components, i.e. computer-aug- mented objects integrating room elements with information technology. We present the current realization of i-LAND in terms of an interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, two computer-enhanced chairs, and two bridges for the Passage-mechanism. This is complemented by the description of the creativity support application and the technological infrastructure. The paper is accompanied by a video figure in the CHI99 video program.},

abstract = {“The desktop is dead,” declares David Gelernter. Gelernter is referring to the “desktop metaphor”-the term frequently used for the hierarchical system of files, folders and icons that we use to manage information stored on our home or office computers. At the annual gathering of technophiles at TechXNY/PC Expo 2001 in New York last June, he told the rapt crowd attending his keynote speech that the desktop metaphor is nothing more than virtual Tupperware. “Our electronic documents are scattered by the thousands in all sorts of little containers all over the place,” he said. “The more information and the more computers in our lives, the more of a nuisance this system becomes.”},

abstract = {Visualising map-based data on mobile devices presents many challenges. Small displays, comparatively slow hardware and awkward interaction techniques all combine to make mobile map-based visualisations difficult to design and often frustrating to use. Existing mobile visualisation techniques do not adequately address these problems. Adaptive user interfaces, which adapt to the individual characteristics of the user, are proposed as an alternative approach to improve mobile map-based visualisation (MMV) systems. A model is presented which incorporates an adaptive user interface into the design of MMV systems. A prototype MMV system, called MediaMaps, is then described, demonstrating the successful implementation of this model. The results of an evaluation of MediaMaps are then presented, showing its effectiveness in supporting user needs and requirements for MMV using an adaptive user interface.},

abstract = {Computer display system users must integrate data across successive displays. This problem of across-display processing is analogous to the question of how the visual system combines data across successive glances (fixations). Research from cognitive psychology on the latter question is used in order to formulate guidelines for the display designer. The result is a new principle of person-computer interaction, visual momentum, which captures knowledge about the mechanisms that support the identification of “relevant” data in human perception so that display system design can support an effective distribution of user attention. The negative consequences of low visual momentum on user performance are described, and display design techniques are presented to improve user across-display information extraction.},

abstract = {In recent years, mobile devices have rapidly penetrated into our daily lives. However, several drawbacks of mobile devices have been mentioned so far. The proposed system called Toss-It provides intuitive information transfer techniques for mobile devices, by fully utilizing their mobility. A user of Toss-It can send information from the user's PDA to other electronic devices with a toss or swing action, as the user would toss a ball or deal cards to others. This paper describes the current implementation of Toss-It and its user studies.},
