    <h2>Infer.NET 2.5 Release</h2>
    
    <h3>Welcome to Infer.NET!</h3>
    
    <p> Infer.NET is a library for probabilistic inference in graphical
    models providing state-of-the-art message-passing algorithms, graph algorithms,
    and linear algebra routines needed by modern machine learning applications.
    Infer.NET is pure .NET and Microsoft-owned. It is available under a 
	non-commercial license.</p>

    <p> Infer.NET Fun is a domain-specific language for probabilistic modelling that is embedded in F# and compiled to Infer.NET.</p>
    
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    
    <p>Documentation is available in online form at
	<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/infernet">
	http://research.microsoft.com/infernet</a>. It includes a user guide, tutorials and examples, and code 
	documentation. The user guide is also provided as a standalone .CHM file as part of 
        the installation.</p>
	<h3>
        Installation</h3>
	<p>
        Infer.NET is distributed as a zip-file (this is a change from previous beta 
        releases). Copy this to a folder of your choice, and unzip. The folder structure 
        looks as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infer.NET<ul>
            <li>Bin</li>
            <li>Source<ul>
                <li>Distributions</li>
                <li>Factors</li>
                <li>Wrappers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Samples</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Fun</li>
                <li>IronPython</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Documentation</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Bin folder contains the Infer.NET dlls.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infer.Compiler.dll is the compiler assembly which takes model descriptions 
            written using the Infer.NET API, and converts them to inference code.</li>
        <li>Infer.Runtime.dll is the assembly needed to execute the inference code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Typically during development you will need to reference both these dlls, but in 
        some deployment scenarios you may decide to use pre-compiled code which needs 
        the Runtime dll only.
    </p>
    <p>
        Infer.Fun.dll and Infer.FSharp.dll are different ways to interact with Infer.NET 
        from F#:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a id="1::Introducing Infer.NET Fun|Infer.Fun.dll" class="style1" 
                href="http://infernet/Wiki/Wiki%20Pages/Introducing%20Infer.NET%20Fun.aspx">
            Infer.Fun.dll</a> is the assembly for Fun, a syntax extension of F# to allow 
            succinct descriptions of probabilistic models directly in F#.</li>
        <li><a id="2::FSharp Wrapper|Infer.FSharp.dll" class="style1" 
                href="http://infernet/Wiki/Wiki%20Pages/FSharp%20Wrapper.aspx">
            Infer.FSharp.dll</a> is a wrapper dll that hides some of the generic constructs 
            in the Infer.NET API allowing simpler calls to the Infer.NET API from standard 
            F#.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Bin folder also contains the Examples Browser application which shows and 
        runs code for several tutorial examples and applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        More complicated C# examples are provided as Visual Studio solutions in the 
        Sample Solutions folder. Note that the Silverlight version of the Clinical trial 
        example will not run if it is installed on a network drive.</p>
    <p>
        Fun and Iron Python examples are also available under the Samples folder. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Source folder shows some of the runtime source for Infer.NET - in particular 
        the distribution classes and the factor classes. The distribution classes can 
        also be thought of as message classes in that they contain all the operations 
        needed to mainpulate distributions within message passing algorithms. The factor 
        classes contain the operations that calculate the output messages for various 
        factors and input messages.</p>
    <p>
        The source folder also contains the sources for F# and Iron Python wrappers, as 
        well as an __init__ file for Iron Python.</p>
    <p>
        The documentation folder contains a standalone offline version of the User Guide 
        and Application Programming Interface. In addition there are two guides, an 
        Introduction and Infer.Net 101; the latter is tutorial in nature and guides you 
        through building progressively more complex models, whilst paying attention to 
        good software development practice. There is also a Fun Interfaces subfolder which 
        contains signature files for the Fun assembly; these files document the Fun public APIs.</p>
